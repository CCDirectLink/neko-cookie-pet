# neko-cookie-pet
A custom pet for CrossCode based on "leaCheeseAngry" emote.

Update-
Now everything works, I have to fix how it looks tho, it's too big and movement animations are a bit "off". 

# how to install
You will need to install CCLoader, item-api, templating-api in order for mod to work. I recommend using CCMS for installing apis.

# some important info
I'm currently really busy with some stuff irl but ill try to fix animations and everything in a month(?) or so.
The mod is based on code of Palicat mod which was made by Rioreur.
ac2pic found the issue in code and told me how to fix it :heart:
